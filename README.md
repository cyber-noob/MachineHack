# MachineHack

So I came around this recent Hackathon on MachineHack called the Great Indian Hiring Hackathon and initially I was really interested to have a healthy competion alongside learning something new side by side which I did but my issue was in the Dataset there was a column called Description which had some random integers in it which did not make any sense. Anyways this is my take on approching the problem and do feel free to contact me if you have any queries or suggestions.

Thank You
